  This is the revamped user interface (beta) of TEAMMATES (released mid-2020) -- faster and more mobile-friendly than the previous version.
  We welcome <a [href]="'mailto:' + supportEmail" class="alert-link">your feedback</a> on the new interface.
  You can keep using the previous user interface (until 10 Oct 2020) by going <a [href]="redirectUrl" class="alert-link">here</a>.
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close" (click)="isDismissed=true">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
  </button>
</div>
